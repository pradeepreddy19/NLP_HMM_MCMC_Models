## Part 1: Part-of-speech tagging

### Simple Model:
The implementation of this algorithm is very simple as the logic is very simple 

### HMM Solved Using Viterbi Algorithm:

Problems:
* We faced the issue of probabailties becoming very small and due this we were not able to procedd further and the accuracies for the words and sentences was very low 
 *  Resolution: The way how to tackled this problem of small probabalities is to use lograthimc value of those  probabilties 


### MCMC - Solved using Gibbs Sampling:

Pointers:
75 samples
taking lot of time for 1000 samples 

Note: All the probabilties here are only for numerators and
